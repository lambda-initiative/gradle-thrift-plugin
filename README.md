gradle-thrift-plugin
=====================

the code is original based on https://github.com/iamsteveholmes/scrooge-gradle-plugin

I'm going to rewrite this plugin, there is several goal in mind:

1. improve support of scrooge
2. make it usable both for scrooge and general thrift
3. use sourceSet to specify the file

maybe avoid use scala so it could be easily put into
